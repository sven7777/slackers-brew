# Slackers Brewing — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

React-based homebrew brewery inventory and order management tool for the Slackers brewing group. Tracks ingredient stock (malts, hops, yeast, adjuncts) and calculates order quantities needed for selected recipes. Data persists through a swappable data-access layer: browser localStorage by default, or a shared Supabase (Postgres + Auth) backend when configured — the app code is identical either way.

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm install       # install deps
npm run dev       # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # production build to dist/
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run preview   # preview production build
npm test          # Vitest single run (used by CI)
npm run test:watch # Vitest watch mode
```

## Architecture

[src/App.jsx](src/App.jsx) is a thin shell: it owns all persistent state and renders the header + tab nav. UI and logic are split into modules. There is no routing or state-management library — just React hooks with inline style objects.

```
src/
  components/   # reusable tables: InvTable, RecEditTable
  features/     # one folder per tab: inventory/, recipes/, order/, settings/
                #   — plus auth/ (Supabase session + login gate). recipes/ also
                #   holds the BrewSheetPanel + CellarPanel sub-views.
  hooks/        # usePersistentState (async-aware; routes through repo.js)
  lib/          # pure logic + data + the data-access seam (see below)
  styles.js     # shared inline-style objects
  App.jsx       # shell: state wiring, settings-driven header, tab routing
```

When adding features, keep extending this structure (pure logic → `lib/` with unit tests; reusable UI → `components/`; a tab → `features/`). Do not let logic accumulate back in App.jsx.

**Four tabs:**
- **Inventory** — editable quantity inputs for all ingredients
- **Recipes** — pick a recipe from one dropdown, then a segmented sub-nav (local state, not persisted) switches between three views of it:
  - **Edit** — view/edit ingredient lists per recipe; add/remove ingredients; edit the per-recipe cellar schedule; reset to preset; import a BeerSmith `.bsmx` ([ImportBeerSmith.jsx](src/features/recipes/ImportBeerSmith.jsx)). Reset/Import live here only.
  - **Brew Sheet** — printable brew-day sheet (staged additions, mash, water salts; single/double batch) — [BrewSheetPanel.jsx](src/features/recipes/BrewSheetPanel.jsx)
  - **Cellar Sheet** — printable post-brew cellar log; enter a brew date and the recipe's day-offset schedule auto-fills every dated box (cold crash, bung, dry hop, rouse, transfer, keg) plus yeast / dry-hop / cellar additions — [CellarPanel.jsx](src/features/recipes/CellarPanel.jsx)
- **Order Calculator** — select recipes (single/double batch) → computed order summary
- **Settings** — brewery identity (name, tagline, emoji/logo icon) and data backup (export/import all app data as JSON)

The Brew Sheet / Cellar Sheet panels take the selected `recipe` as a prop (the shared `selR` picker drives all three views); each owns only its print-specific control (batch toggle / brew date).

**Persistence** flows through a single seam, [src/lib/repo.js](src/lib/repo.js) (`load`/`save`): the app (via the `usePersistentState` hook) never touches a backend directly. The default backend is localStorage ([src/lib/storage.js](src/lib/storage.js)); when Supabase env vars are present, [src/main.jsx](src/main.jsx) calls `setBackend(createSupabaseBackend(...))` at startup and wraps the app in [LoginGate](src/features/auth/LoginGate.jsx) so all queries run authenticated. The hook is async-aware (returns `[val, setVal, {loading, error}]`) since the Supabase path is networked; the localStorage path stays synchronous. localStorage keys are prefixed `slackers_brew_` and JSON-stringified: `tab`, `malts`, `hops`, `yeast`, `adj`, `selR`, `orders`, `recipes`, `settings`.

## Data Model

Ingredient defaults live in [src/lib/defaults.js](src/lib/defaults.js):
- `defMalts` — 19 malts, quantity in lbs
- `defHops` — 14 hops, quantity in oz
- `defYeast` — 8 yeast strains, quantity in packs
- `defAdj` — 13 adjuncts with per-item units (lbs/oz/ml/each)
- `defSalts` — water-chemistry salts (names only; amounts live per-recipe)

`defRecipes` — 18 preset recipes, each `{n, s, og, fg, abv, mt, m[], h[], y[], a[], sa[], sc[]}` (name, style, target OG/FG/ABV, single-infusion mash temp, malts, hops, yeast, adjuncts, water salts, cellar schedule). Tuple shapes: malt/yeast `[name, qty]`; hop `[name, qty, stage, time]`; adjunct `[name, qty, unit, stage, time]`; salt `[name, qty, stage]`; schedule `[dayOffset, action]`. Additions carry a **stage** (`brewDayStages`/`cellarStages`/`saltStages` in defaults.js) and may repeat the same name at different stages (e.g. a hop at boil, whirlpool, and dry hop). `computeOrder()` aggregates by name, so it ignores stage/time. The cellar `sc` schedule (actions from `cellarActions`) is the spine of the Cellar Summary sheet: entering a brew date computes each step's date (`brewDate + dayOffset`). Only All Y'alls ships with a seeded schedule; other recipes start empty and are filled in the Recipes tab.

`lib/beersmith.js` parses BeerSmith 3 `.bsmx` files into this recipe model (oz→lb grain, sugar→adjunct routing, name normalization, stage/time), reporting unmapped ingredients. It's the shared parser for both the offline seed generator and the in-app import ([ImportBeerSmith.jsx](src/features/recipes/ImportBeerSmith.jsx) via [lib/importRecipe.js](src/lib/importRecipe.js)). Note: BeerSmith recomputes OG/FG/ABV for display and never persists them, so the parser leaves recipe `og/fg/abv` null rather than import a stored design value that wouldn't match. When the Supabase backend is active, recipe data is normalized into Postgres rows ([supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql)); schema/data changes ship as files under [supabase/migrations/](supabase/migrations/).

`defSettings` — brewery identity `{name, tagline, emoji, logo}`. `logo` is a base64 data URL (or `null`); when set it overrides `emoji` in the header.

## Key Computed Logic

`computeOrder()` in [src/lib/orderCalc.js](src/lib/orderCalc.js) aggregates selected recipe needs, compares against current inventory, and returns `{malts, hops, yeast, adj}` arrays with `{n, need, have, order}` per ingredient. `maltBags(order)` computes 55 lb bag counts. Both are pure and unit-tested in `orderCalc.test.js`.

The printable sheets each have a pure recipe→view-model builder, kept out of the React component so the layout + routing are unit-testable: `buildBrewSheet()` ([src/lib/brewSheet.js](src/lib/brewSheet.js)) for Brew Day (brew-day-stage additions, grain bill, salts; excludes cellar stages + yeast) and `buildCellarSheet(recipe, brewDate)` ([src/lib/cellarSheet.js](src/lib/cellarSheet.js)) for Cellar Summary (schedule date math + routing to cold-crash/bung/dry-hop/rouse/transfer/keg boxes + yeast + cellar additions).

[src/lib/backup.js](src/lib/backup.js) handles data export/import: `buildBackup()` serializes all `slackers_brew_*` localStorage into a portable JSON object; `applyBackup()` validates and restores one (clearing existing app keys first). It also served as the localStorage→Supabase migration tool.

## Style Conventions

- Inline CSS-in-JS objects only — no CSS file, no Tailwind. Shared objects in [src/styles.js](src/styles.js).
- Color accent: `#f59e0b` (amber)
- Neutral grays from Tailwind's slate palette
- Shared style vars: `cell`, `num`, `inp`, `th`, `btn`, `card`, `hdr`, `badge`, `rmBtn`, `addRow`, `sel`, `addBtn`, `tabBtn`

## Testing

Vitest + React Testing Library (jsdom). Tests are co-located with source (`*.test.js[x]`); shared setup in [src/test/setup.js](src/test/setup.js). Prefer unit-testing pure logic in `lib/`. CI runs lint + test + build on every push/PR.

## Working Conventions

- **Persist the roadmap to memory by default.** When we make a significant decision, finish a work chunk, or define the next step, save it to project memory so it survives across sessions — keep the relevant roadmap file (e.g. `data-layer-roadmap.md`) current rather than relying on the session todo list (which is ephemeral). Update or prune stale entries instead of duplicating.
- **Branch → PR workflow.** `main` is protected; land all changes through a PR that passes CI (lint + test + build + CodeQL). Branch prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`.

## What Doesn't Exist

- No TypeScript, no CSS framework, no routing/state library, no undo/redo
